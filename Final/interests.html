<h1>Drums</h1>
<p>i started playing drums when i was in 6th grade and joined the school band. i stayed in band until i graduated and can play many different percussion instruments. But when i was 16 my parents got me a drum set, which we didn't have at school, and i could practice at home. over time i've gotten pretty good at playing them and like to play them with my friends who can play guitar and bass guitar. For the past few years i've only been able to play them occasionally because i don't take them with me while at MSu. But i'm looking forward to picking them up again soon and playing more often once i graduate.</p>

<h1>Biking</h1>
<p>Like most kids i enjoyed riding my bike when i was younger. it wasn't until my college years that i got my new bike and started going on longer bike trips. in my somewhat rural hometown of Bath there are plenty of low traffic roads to bike on safely and plenty of nature to see. i also enjoy biking on campus as it is somewhat challenging with all the people rushing to their next destinations. You have to pay attention to what everyone is doing and anticipate what they are going to do next. Most people may just keep going straight but what if they stop or see a friend and change direction at the last second? The heightened sense of awareness is exciting and that's what makes it fun for me to ride on campus.</p>

<h1>Movies</h1>
<p>Everyone likes movies! i like most movie genres except horror movies, especially the more recent ones that are overly gory instead of genuinely scary. Some of my favorite movies include District 9, the Lord of the Rings trilogy, Star Wars, Planet of the Apes, Catch Me if You Can, and all the new Marvel movies like Iron man and The Avengers. </p>
