<p>Because i grew up in Bath so close to East Lansing i've always liked MSu. And when i graduated high school MSu was my first choice of colleges to go so i was very happy i was accepted. i've been studying Media and Information in the College of Communication Arts and Sciences with a specilization in Information Technology. i hope to be a web devoloper/designer once i finish my degree.</p>
